1
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,617
Okay, let's practice

2
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,575
Come, get ready

3
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:26,950
One

4
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:28,367
Two

5
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:29,783
One

6
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,450
Two

7
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,575
Young Master, there is a Master
Liao looking for you

8
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,408
This is...

9
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,617
I am the Master of the Liao's Fist

10
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,867
Just opened a dojo in Fuoshan

11
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:24,908
Congratulations

12
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:28,575
I heard that your Wing Chun fist is very good

13
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,200
That's why I came here today to
get some pointers

14
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,033
Make it another day, okay?

15
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:35,575
Now is not the right time

16
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,408
Since I am here

17
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,033
and just sparring only,
won't take too much time

18
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:44,492
Let's close the doors and spar.
Win or lose, nobody will know

19
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:46,783
It's not a matter of winning or losing,
I am having my meals right now

20
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,117
Then, I'll wait for you

21
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,158
Master Liao, have you eaten?

22
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:05,658
Come, join us.

23
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,575
You smoke?

24
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,075
It's okay

25
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:55,533
How are the dishes tonight?

26
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,992
Good

27
00:04:59,158 --> 00:04:59,992
That is good

28
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,533
Very quick

29
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:18,575
Uncle Wang, don't clean up the table.
Just close the door first

30
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,867
Master Liao

31
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:00,033
Please

32
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:01,950
Please

33
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,033
Are you okay?

34
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,242
I'm okay. I'm okay.

35
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,658
One more time

36
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,117
Then, here I come

37
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,075
Hit!

38
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,950
Hit! Hit!

39
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,325
All hits!

40
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,242
Hit!

41
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:01,783
Thank you for letting me win, Master Liao

42
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:20,117
Thank you for the lesson. I've learnt a lot
Same here. Same here

43
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,575
Today's closed door sparring... Master Ip

44
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,742
Don't worry, it'll never leak out

45
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:29,408
Thank you very much. I am taking my leave

46
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,742
Do be careful

47
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,492
I am not sending you off

48
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,492
Ip Man's "Heavenly King smashing the tower" One more
time and using the "Four Taels to heave a thousand katis"

49
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:43,200
that thrown Master Liao's to a
thunderous grounding

50
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:44,908
Isn't that stroke used in Tai Chi Quan?

51
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,700
I heard that Mast Ip practice Wing Chun, right?

52
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,242
Whatever! Anyway, he just push
him away with just one hand

53
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:53,867
Master Liao still did not concede defeat Later,
Ip Man ferociously chased after him and beat him up

54
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:57,033
But Master Liao after being beaten
is still not satisfied

55
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,242
and uses "Hungry Dog snatch faeces"
to beat Ip Man

56
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:05,783
This type of tea leaves is very nice.
It's cheap

57
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,825
Do be careful
Thank you

58
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,075
Goodbye. See you again the next time

59
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:16,117
Uncle Ping, who put this here?

60
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,617
It's your younger brother

61
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:21,033
Initially I thought Master Liao's kung fu is good
but he didn't even have a chance to attack

62
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,033
Being beaten like a pig's head

63
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,158
He also have a share in our father's teahouse

64
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,075
Always loitering and fooling around

65
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,200
Ask that asshole to take care of the customers

66
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:30,992
Good morning

67
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:31,867
Brother Man

68
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,825
Is Brother Quan is here?

69
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,908
He's waiting for you upstairs

70
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,158
Ah Quan, have you been waiting long?

71
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,575
You are always late

72
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,908
Busy!

73
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,033
Busy with what?

74
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:50,617
It's always the same.
Eat, drink and kung fu

75
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,617
What's there to be busy about?

76
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,825
This tea is quite fragrant

77
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,575
I am saying you!

78
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,075
Let's order some food

79
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,117
I've something to discuss with you

80
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,950
Eat first, we'll talk later

81
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:09,117
Fresh from the oven. Come, try it!

82
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,658
I heard them say,
you had a duel with Master Liao

83
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,533
and quickly defeated him
Is that true?

84
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,408
Who told you, Crazy Lin

85
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,950
My younger brother

86
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:22,075
You should have told me earlier
I've even ask him to be my sifu

87
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,742
You've ask every sifu in town to be your master

88
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:28,117
Brother Man, did you have a closed door duel?

89
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,408
We've something to discuss. Please go

90
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,575
Then, I will not disturb your discussion

91
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,117
Good morning Master

92
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,533
Good morning Master
Good morning

93
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:51,908
Master
Good morning

94
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,075
Good morning Master
Good morning

95
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,867
Master, someone said you got beaten by Ip Man

96
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,908
Now, everyone in Fuoshan knows about it

97
00:09:59,033 --> 00:09:59,867
Nonsense, who said it?

98
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:01,450
Sha Dan Yuan from the teahouse

99
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,242
The cost of things in Fuoshan have risen

100
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,492
So what about it?

101
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,408
That is to say, Fuoshan's economy is good

102
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,658
Everyone have expendable income

103
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,158
Really?

104
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,742
Think about it! Clothes, food, accommodation
and travels. Clothes comes first

105
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:25,700
In future, the demand for cloth will be huge

106
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,575
That is why I want to set up a cotton factory
so that I can supply them to the cloth factory

107
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,658
I want you to be my partner

108
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,408
I am not suitable for business

109
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:39,200
It's okay, I am suitable

110
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:40,742
I am not in need money

111
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,408
Who is Sha Dan Yuan? Get the hell out here!

112
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,575
I am

113
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,158
You're the one talking nonsense
and ruining my reputation? Sifu

114
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,325
I want to teach you a lesson today
Sifu Sifu

115
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,658
He's my younger brother. Let's talk slowly

116
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,075
Don't get angry, sifu

117
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:01,325
Your brother

118
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,200
Your brother is talking nonsense
and ruined my reputation

119
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:05,658
Said I lost to Ip Man in a fight

120
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:07,992
Tell me, how can I survive in Dojo Street?

121
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,617
How can I open my dojo and take in students?

122
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:10,742
Sifu! Apologize now!

123
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,242
I am not in the wrong. I just stating facts

124
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,242
You're talking nonsense
Sifu

125
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,283
Ip Man is upstairs. If you've got
the balls, go find him!

126
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,533
What! Go!

127
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,617
Sifu, cool down, cool down

128
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,617
Sifu Sifu Don't get angry. Sifu

129
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,325
Master Ip, I've been wronged!

130
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,242
Sifu Sifu

131
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,325
Please, tell everyone

132
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,408
that you have a duel with Master Liao
and beaten him

133
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:50,533
Master Ip, you must clear my name

134
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:55,075
Still telling lies!? And troubling Brother Man!

135
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,658
I did not lie

136
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,075
When I was retrieving my kite,
I saw them fighting

137
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:03,825
What a coincidence that your kite broke loose
and landed in Brother Man's garden

138
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,492
and what a coincidence that you saw Master
Liao and Brother Man having a duel

139
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,617
and coincidentally, the whole scene
was seen by you?!

140
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,075
There is just too much coincidences!

141
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:11,450
Yes, it's all coincidences

142
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:14,117
Even if it's true, you can't go
around telling everyone

143
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:15,325
There are some things which one can't admit

144
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:16,408
If it's true then one won't be afraid
to admit it

145
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,700
If one admits one would lose face

146
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,533
Lose what face? How should I know?

147
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,075
This is called " Lose face"

148
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:30,033
Crazy Lin, no need to be like this

149
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,408
What are you laughing at!
Don't treat me like I am not around!

150
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,033
Sir, it's a small matter

151
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,825
What small matter?

152
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:36,825
Disperse...

153
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:37,742
Don't go!

154
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,408
Sir, small matter

155
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,742
I've seen everything. Let me tell all of you

156
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,658
whoever create trouble in my territory,
not obeying the law

157
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:45,867
I will arrest them

158
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:49,950
I didn't come here to create trouble
It's someone who ruined my reputation

159
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,158
I am here for justice

160
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:53,617
What justice? I am justice

161
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,742
You bunch of loafers, fighting everyday

162
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,242
What era is it now?

163
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,450
Still going for duels!

164
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:05,117
Let's duel with weapons. Gun! Gun!

165
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,200
Do you know?!

166
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,325
You also know, Inspector Lee

167
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:37,075
we, practitioners of martial arts have lots of
energy and sometimes may be loud in our speech

168
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,658
But being loud in our speech does
not mean that we have no manners

169
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:44,533
Technically, we are all cultured people
No need to draw your gun for any small matter

170
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,408
Give me some face

171
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,825
Crazy Lin, take care of Insp. Lee. All on me

172
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,033
Good

173
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:52,617
Insp. Lee, this way please

174
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,908
What are you looking at? Quick scram

175
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,158
Don't look! All disperse

176
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:57,992
Insp. Lee, please

177
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:02,533
Master Liao

178
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,075
Take care

179
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,117
Why are you so secretive?

180
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,325
I am really not suitable to do business

181
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,283
Take it and open the factory.
When you have profit then you can pay me

182
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,242
I won't be able to repay you so quickly

183
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,450
Take your time to pay

184
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,575
Do me one more favor.
Accept my son as your student

185
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,242
There are so many Masters in Dojo Street
just ask any of them will do

186
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,700
Those masters are not as good as you

187
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,367
About the same

188
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:43,783
Crazy Lin

189
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,575
Brother Quan

190
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,533
Brother Man, I've learned a new technique
You help me to test it, alright?

191
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:52,367
You're so free!
Have you found your younger brother yet?

192
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:55,408
Don't worry about him. Once his money is
depleted, he'll come back

193
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:57,658
Let's try

194
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,242
Father, is Uncle Man willing?

195
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,617
You go and have a look first

196
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,908
Ah June, your drawings are so beautiful

197
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,742
Let's see what moves you've learn this time

198
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,450
It has defense when attacking and in
defense there is element of attacking

199
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,200
when attacking there is defense and
in defense there is attack

200
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,950
The words you say are all the same

201
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:23,908
You won't understand, kid. Go further away

202
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:39,992
This move is to attack the middle section.
Very deadly

203
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,783
Don't just know how to say the words
Most important is to get a hit

204
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,908
Mother, I've finished drawing

205
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,367
It's so good. Let Daddy have a look

206
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:49,408
Okay

207
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,033
Use attack as defense. Continued
defense is attack

208
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,783
That's what I do
What I did earlier on is constant defense

209
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,908
Daddy, have a look

210
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,075
Daddy is not free. Later...

211
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:56,492
Don't understand

212
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:57,283
Yes

213
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,242
One more time

214
00:15:58,617 --> 00:15:59,367
One more time

215
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,825
Daddy won't look

216
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,575
You've already lost
What?

217
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,158
This is called constant defense with attack

218
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,742
Master Ip, one more time. I didn't see clearly

219
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,367
See! See! See! What's there to see!?

220
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,867
Come here everyday and fight, fight fight!
Really frustrating!

221
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,867
Brother Man, what now?

222
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,825
Sister-in-law, I am sorry

223
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:39,283
Sister-in-law, I am leaving

224
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:40,908
I am not saying you

225
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,408
No, there are lots of things to
do in the factory

226
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:47,617
Ah Yeow

227
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,075
Uncle Man, we are leaving

228
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,575
Okay, come again the next time

229
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:57,825
We're leaving

230
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:07,492
If you are not happy, you can tell me.
No need to throw your temper

231
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:11,742
Okay. I am asking you now to look
at the son's drawings

232
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,367
Show more concern
and don't stay with your friends all day

233
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,825
Let's go in, okay?

234
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,867
Slowly

235
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:48,325
Brother

236
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,158
Where is Dojo Street?

237
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:51,075
Ah...

238
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,158
Dojo

239
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:53,908
Go straight ahead

240
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:21,117
One
Two

241
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,742
One
Two

242
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,450
One
Two

243
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,033
One
Two

244
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:33,867
Boss, there are so many dojos,
which one shall we start first?

245
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,742
One
Two

246
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,075
One, retract

247
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,533
Brother! Teaching kung fu?

248
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,075
You guys came here to learn kung fu?
Come in, let's talk

249
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,742
Who is the Dojo master?

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,950
I am the dojo master

251
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:49,658
I am Jin Shan Zhao

252
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,700
I've long admired Fuoshan as the town of
martial arts. I came south especially

253
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:56,283
and would like to exchange
pointers with Masters of Fuoshan.

254
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,450
Exchange pointers!

255
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:00,533
Correct

256
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,492
Then you are here to challenge!?

257
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,408
Yes

258
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:06,492
Okay

259
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,117
All of you stand one side See how your
sifu teach this country bumpkin a lesson

260
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,158
Not that side. This side! This side!

261
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:15,992
Someone here to challenge!

262
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:17,450
What is it?

263
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,742
Look and learn

264
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,575
Boss! Boss! You're terrific!

265
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:21,117
Where is your Master?

266
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
I am here!

267
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,700
You really want to kill me, huh!?

268
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,367
Sifu is not here

269
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,325
Wondered what happen to the weather in Fuoshan
blowing cold and hot

270
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,283
Let me

271
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,075
What are you drawing, Ah June?

272
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:13,742
Ah June is not talking to you

273
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,533
If you are free, do keep him company

274
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,908
Okay

275
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,075
Crazy Lin, so early?

276
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,200
Sister-in-law, I am not here to fight.
Just have a few words and I'll leave

277
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,992
Hey, what is it?

278
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,492
There are a bunch of country bumpkins
going around challenging all the dojos

279
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:52,992
Their kung fu is good
Every dojos have lost

280
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,700
If you can, do go and have a look

281
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:56,992
Really that good?

282
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:57,867
Yes

283
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,158
Sister-in-law, I am leaving now

284
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,158
Hang on, Master Liao

285
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,575
We're all depending on you, Master Liao

286
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,242
Fucking bitch!

287
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,450
There is not one who can fight in Fuoshan

288
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,075
I thought everyone in Fuoshan is like
Wong Fei Hung

289
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,617
but actually they are worms

290
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,117
All weaklings, can't even stand one blow

291
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:36,783
Brothers, we didn't come here for nothing

292
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,658
There is not one who can fight in Fuoshan

293
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,242
This time we're going to get rich

294
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:44,367
Brothers, we've got to keep working hard

295
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,950
Open a martial art school in Fuoshan
and let them know how good we are

296
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:50,700
We got to be number one in Fuoshan

297
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,992
You, country bumpkins! Won a few
masters and you think you are damn good

298
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,658
Win the best, then we'll say

299
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,408
Who is the best in Fuoshan

300
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:02,075
Of course it's Ip Man. Do you think it's me?

301
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:10,825
Let's go

302
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,367
Come! Come!

303
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:14,117
See how we are going to win Ip Man

304
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,783
Daddy, there is a lot of people outside

305
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:49,658
Young Master, they...

306
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:50,742
You are Ip Man?

307
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,908
I am Jin Shan Zhao. I've heard that
Fuoshan is the town of martial arts

308
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:56,325
I know, Master Jin, I know

309
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,908
You've brought so many people
to tell me that you want to challenge me, right?

310
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:00,992
Of course!

311
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:04,408
We are opening a dojo in Fuoshan
We have to show our ability to them

312
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,617
Opening a dojo, right? If you want to open
a dojo, you don't have to fight with me

313
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:10,783
You just have to find a good location
and that's it. Please leave.

314
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,533
Uncle Wang, bring Ah June in

315
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,283
Ip Man

316
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:24,117
Don't give any excuses
Are you afraid and don't want to fight

317
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:29,283
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Do you think my house is a dojo?!

318
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:31,075
Do you think you can just come in
and fight and kill? Get out!

319
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:33,825
You heard her. I won't fight with you

320
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,242
Please leave immediately

321
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:38,825
I heard that Wing Chun fist is developed
by a woman

322
00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:40,658
I think it's very suitable for you

323
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,908
Ip Man, you're really henpecked

324
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,158
There is not anyone that is afraid
of their wives

325
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,408
but men who respect their wives

326
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:54,200
Mrs. Ip, don't worry.
I won't kill him

327
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,033
If you are afraid that he would lose,
I'll use one hand

328
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,533
If not,
I will not use both my hands

329
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,908
Master Ip, fight

330
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,158
Fuoshan have really disappointed me

331
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:10,825
There are so many martial arts
practitioner but there is none

332
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:11,742
Shut up!

333
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,242
Don't break anything in the house

334
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:24,950
Give way! Give way! Give way!

335
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:26,575
Give way! Give way!

336
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:35,408
You bunch of...

337
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,658
You came at the right time.
This is a small place

338
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,242
Please ask all the people to go out
and please close the door on your way out

339
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:48,033
You must win back our reputation

340
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:52,242
Let them go out!
Quick!

341
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,242
Faster! Faster! Out!

342
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,242
Out! Out!

343
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:16,950
Wing Chun, Ip Man

344
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,075
I really like to see

345
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,575
how a macho man
uses a woman's martial arts

346
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:28,783
Good kung fu does not have sex or
age differentiation

347
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:32,200
Have to see who is using it
You will know immediately how it is fought

348
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:34,658
Please

349
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:12,742
I'll pay

350
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:15,075
Good

351
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,783
How is it? How is it?

352
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:20,908
Who is better?

353
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,033
I'll pay

354
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,075
Daddy, mummy says

355
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,117
if you won't attack,
all the things in the house will be broken

356
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,200
Okay...

357
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,742
Little rascal!

358
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:53,325
Be careful what you say!

359
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:09,658
Boss

360
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:31,742
Boss

361
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:33,742
Boss Boss

362
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,367
Master Jin, are you alright?

363
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,158
I am okay

364
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,742
How is it, Master Jin?
Do you think my kung fu is okay?

365
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:14,908
No need to say

366
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:20,075
Today, the northern fist
have lost to the southern fist

367
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:25,908
You're wrong. The problem lies not within
Northern or Southern Fist. It lies within you

368
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:35,325
Who lost and who won?

369
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:39,533
No need to ask. Look at his pig face
you'll know that he had lost

370
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:41,367
Scram!

371
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,367
Sifu

372
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:50,950
Brother Man Okay, good show
Master Ip

373
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,533
You have saved the reputation of
all the dojos in Fuoshan

374
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:55,075
It's luck. It's luck

375
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:57,825
I would say that you are the
jewel of Kwangtung

376
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:03,367
Thank you

377
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:05,742
This has just been imported from overseas.
Please, look around

378
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:06,825
Mr. Ip, this is your wife's flowers
Thank you

379
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,117
Boss, how much is it?

380
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,408
No need money, Master Ip

381
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,700
You've brought glory to the people of Fuoshan
How can I take your money?

382
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:12,825
I can't don't pay?

383
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,408
You're doing business, right?
Really, there's no need to pay, Master Ip

384
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,742
You're too kind
Don't be

385
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:16,950
The next time
Okay, the next time

386
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,033
Master Ip, have some fruits
So kind

387
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:21,283
For the kids
How could you...

388
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,575
Goodbye, Master Ip
Thank you

389
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:24,533
Little friend, for you to play

390
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:25,908
Say, thanks

391
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:27,367
Thank you
No need to

392
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,408
Thank you
Take care

393
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,867
Master Ip, how are you?

394
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,075
Master Ip, how are you?
Mrs. Su, how are you?

395
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:33,075
This is not bad

396
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,825
This is the best in our shop

397
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:39,450
If this could be in your house
it would be my honor

398
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,617
You're kind

399
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:43,783
Why is it so crowded?

400
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,950
Uncle Man, Auntie

401
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,367
You are so sly

402
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,575
If you want to open a dojo
Why didn't you inform me first?

403
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:52,242
When did I say I want to open a dojo?

404
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,325
The whole of Fuoshan knows about it

405
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,908
Everyone in Fuoshan knows, except me

406
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,408
Uncle Man, let me help you

407
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,075
Sifu Master

408
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,075
Fellow disciples

409
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,117
Looks like you're the one who spread the rumor

410
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:12,700
You've better fix this mess

411
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,575
Come, walk yourself

412
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:21,200
I don't care
Ah Yeow must be your first student

413
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,575
There you go again.
This is not the first day you know me

414
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,992
I'll never accept any disciples

415
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,033
Quiet!

416
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:30,825
We must observe rules.
Once we observe rules, it will be right!

417
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,950
Master Ip Master Ip

418
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:38,283
Master Ip Master Ip

419
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,742
Wing Seng, I am going out for awhile.
Will be back soon

420
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:32,783
Wait

421
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:49,367
It's cold outside. Wear one more

422
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:00,492
Ip June

423
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:03,700
Ip June, be careful.
Don't hurt others

424
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,367
Master Ip, I gave you a bit more

425
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:33,450
Thank you very much

426
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:37,242
No need to rush

427
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,617
Next! You take this

428
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:41,033
Once you have taken, leave immediately

429
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:44,825
One by one. Line up

430
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:05,867
This factory might be old but
it's still not bad

431
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,333
Fuoshan is now in a mass of confusion

432
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,583
You've gone. Why come back?

433
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,667
If I don't come back,
where would the workers have money to eat

434
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,500
My money is all invested here

435
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,833
I still can't pay you now

436
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,583
No need. If you don't say,
I would have forgotten about it

437
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,375
This can't be.
I'll treat it that you have invested here

438
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:36,542
It might be little but it still
have 10% of the shares

439
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:37,958
Really, there's no need

440
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,542
Stay and help me.
After all you have a share in it

441
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:44,583
Uncle Man

442
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:45,958
Kwong Yeow

443
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,833
You're here to help? That's great!

444
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,958
With you to lead us,
everyone would be more energetic

445
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,417
and I can also watch you practice
Wing Chun fist

446
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:55,542
Stay and have your meals here.
The workers are about to have theirs

447
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,625
Yes, join us

448
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,500
No need

449
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,042
I still have things to do.
Next time

450
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,083
I am leaving now

451
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,792
Father, why don't you ask Uncle Man to stay

452
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,833
I understand him all too well

453
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,792
Daddy, didn't you always practice martial arts?

454
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,833
Why didn't you practice nowadays?

455
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,542
If daddy move too much, daddy would get hungry

456
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,875
That's why I move less, right?

457
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,500
Uh, I understand

458
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:42,042
Then I won't go out and play

459
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,792
You will only stop playing today. Quick, eat

460
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:46,542
Quick, eat

461
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,917
This porridge is a bit starchy

462
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,375
but somehow you have to eat something

463
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,375
Come

464
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,083
Careful, it's hot

465
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,792
How much rice are there in the house

466
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,042
Don't have to worry

467
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,125
Whatever valuables in the house
have been pawned

468
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,958
Your husband have strength and energy
I can go out and get a job

469
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,500
Won't die

470
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,375
You go out and work?

471
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,917
Of course I have no need to before

472
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:47,125
but now times are bad
There is always a first time

473
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:55,375
We have more than enough people here
Not hiring anymore

474
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,750
Boss, do you require any worker?

475
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,333
No. We've enough

476
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,333
Sorry to trouble you

477
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,542
Boss, employ me

478
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,833
You! You! You! Come up

479
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,125
Boss! Boss!

480
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,458
Master Ip, you're looking for a job?

481
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,583
Come Come

482
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Thank you

483
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:53,708
Brother Man

484
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:04,083
Brother Man, the way you dress is
not suitable for work

485
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,958
How do I know that I'll be digging for coal?!

486
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,417
Master Ip, how are you?

487
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,000
How are you?

488
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,250
Master Ip, how are you?

489
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,333
Why are there so many sifus here?

490
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,042
Right! The boss here used to
practice martial arts

491
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,542
That's why he like to employ
those who knows kung fu

492
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,250
Do you still practice kung fu?

493
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:33,208
If there is time,
I would come out and look for work, right?

494
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,667
Go there and eat

495
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,417
Okay

496
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:55,042
Brother Man, I can't eat anymore
Help me to eat some, okay?

497
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:56,875
Eat a little

498
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,583
How are sister-in-law and Ah June?

499
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:08,042
They're fine. Thanks

500
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,625
Have you found your younger brother?

501
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,875
I haven't seen him since the last time he left

502
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,542
I don't know if he is dead or alive

503
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,042
I don't have a chance even to apologize

504
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:28,958
You lost something?

505
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,375
Yes, I've lost a steel box

506
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,375
What kind of steel box

507
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:33,833
Japanese soldiers!

508
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,667
Japanese soldiers are coming!

509
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:58,375
Fellow workers, this is Colonel Chuodeng

510
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,542
The colonel admires Chinese kung fu

511
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:03,917
and also knows that Fuoshan is
the town of martial arts

512
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:08,875
and like to find those who knows kung fu
and spar with the Japanese

513
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,208
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

514
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,000
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

515
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,917
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

516
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,458
Sifu

517
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,208
You just want us to be their sand bags

518
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,125
Let me tell you, no way!

519
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:41,042
Idiot! If you win there is a bag of rice

520
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:47,667
Those who wins the fight will be
awarded a bag of rice

521
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,667
I'll go

522
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:52,417
Crazy Lin, don't look for trouble

523
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,292
I'll go

524
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:54,708
I'll go too

525
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,375
No, they have stolen our rice

526
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,958
now is our chance to take it back.
It's only fair

527
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,542
Hey! Hey!

528
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:05,542
Forget it!

529
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,708
Help me find the steel box.

530
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,333
Hey!

531
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,208
It's alright. Come

532
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:15,833
Be careful

533
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:16,875
Come, come over and line up

534
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,750
Quick

535
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,292
Are there any more orders?

536
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,167
No. Let's go
Yes

537
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:54,625
Sifu

538
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:57,875
General

539
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,625
Thank you, Sir

540
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:41,042
Okay, good show Okay, good show

541
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,333
Knock them down

542
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,250
Let me go there and have a go

543
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:55,500
They are not your match, General Sanpo

544
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:59,875
Just treat it as to let them know
our Japanese martial arts

545
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:06,917
Find 3 guys to fight with me

546
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,667
Even if they lost,
they would still get a bag of rice

547
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:09,875
Yes

548
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,208
Don't say I didn't help you guys

549
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,958
I've arranged with General Sanpo
to fight with the 3 of you

550
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,417
No matter win or lose,
you'll still get a bag of rice

551
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,750
It's okay if there is no rice.
Most important thing is, is to beat them up

552
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,458
Who will go first?

553
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,458
I'll go! I'll go!

554
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:30,792
Let go! Keep quiet!

555
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,208
Crazy Lin! You! You! 3 men

556
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,792
Ok

557
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:35,375
Hey, you're vomiting blood. Stop fighting

558
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:38,625
We've lost!

559
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,208
General, they've admit defeat

560
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:15,542
What nonsense!
Do you really want to die?

561
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,083
You bastard!

562
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,542
Crazy Lin! How are you?!

563
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:38,167
Crazy Lin! Crazy Lin!

564
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,250
Are you tired today?

565
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,500
Just digging coal. It's not tiring.

566
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,083
I saw Crazy Lin today

567
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,542
Really? How is he now?

568
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:06,500
Still okay

569
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,667
I've never thought I would meet him

570
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,375
Master Li! Master Hung!

571
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,833
Have you seen Crazy Lin?

572
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,083
Crazy Lin? I've not seen him

573
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,708
Let's eat first

574
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,792
Yesterday, many people have gotten their rice
General Sanpo is very satisfied

575
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,458
Is there anyone willing to go today?

576
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,333
Anyone wants to go?
Li Chian

577
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,292
Li Chian, where is Crazy Lin?

578
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,042
Anyone wants to go?

579
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:20,000
I am asking you. Where is Crazy Lin?

580
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,875
I don't know

581
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,917
You don't know?
You are the one who brought him out

582
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:29,333
Anyone wants to go?
If you win, you get a bag of rice

583
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:30,208
I'll go

584
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,000
Master Ip is going, I am going

585
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,083
I'll go

586
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,375
I would like to fight with the Japanese

587
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,208
Is there any more orders?

588
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,958
No. Quick, go

589
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,042
Thank you

590
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:16,750
Can I still fight with 3 more men?

591
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,167
He say, he wants to fight with 3 more men

592
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,708
I won't fight anymore

593
00:54:58,292 --> 00:54:59,458
Why did they shoot?

594
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:04,625
Li Chian Why did they shoot?

595
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:08,792
Li Chian Why did they shoot?

596
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,333
Who ask you to shoot?

597
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:17,625
I saw that he had lost
and still got the guts to take the rice

598
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,208
That is why, I want to teach him a lesson

599
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,750
This place is for martial arts only

600
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,917
Don't ever fire your gun in here again

601
00:55:42,917 --> 00:55:45,042
Understood. General Sanpo, please cool down

602
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:56,500
I will immediately arrange for the next fight

603
00:55:57,542 --> 00:56:00,750
Continue

604
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,708
Anyone else still wants to fight?

605
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,125
I will fight

606
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,667
Li Chian, open the door

607
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,208
Master
Open the door!

608
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:32,083
Please tell me.
Is that how Crazy Lin died?

609
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,625
Open the door!

610
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:38,833
Master

611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Open the door!

612
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,333
Please open the door!

613
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,125
I want to challenge 10 men

614
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,625
You're crazy! Don't be like this!

615
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,083
I want to fight 10 men

616
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:14,667
He says he wants to fight 10 men

617
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,292
10?

618
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:26,542
Yes

619
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,958
I would also like to see

620
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,792
Number 5 platoon!

621
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:40,917
1st group! Third group! Fifth group! Start!

622
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:45,875
Be careful

623
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,208
Stop!

624
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:44,792
Come again

625
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,000
He wants you to come again

626
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,417
I didn't come here for the rice

627
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:55,125
He says, he will come again

628
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:57,750
Hey!

629
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:02,458
What is your name?

630
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,167
He wants to know your name

631
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,083
I am only a Chinese man...

632
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,875
He is Ip Man

633
01:01:51,492 --> 01:01:55,450
You have to be careful from now on
I don't know what Sanpo will do

634
01:02:00,575 --> 01:02:01,658
Traitor!

635
01:02:03,075 --> 01:02:04,492
Why am I a traitor?

636
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:07,075
What have their deaths got to do with me?

637
01:02:07,908 --> 01:02:10,533
I am only a translator. I don't need to eat?

638
01:02:10,658 --> 01:02:11,742
I need to eat

639
01:02:12,117 --> 01:02:13,075
Need to eat?

640
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:17,200
You saw your own country men being killed
Do you have any dignity?

641
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,992
I don't! You have! You have a lot!

642
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,325
If you are so capable, why don't
you kill them all?

643
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,658
Kill 10! Kill 100! Kill 1000!

644
01:02:29,742 --> 01:02:32,533
I am a translator, not a traitor!

645
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,033
I am a Chinese man!

646
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:32,992
I am back

647
01:03:33,158 --> 01:03:34,033
Daddy

648
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,158
You're back

649
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:38,367
Are you a good boy?

650
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:39,158
Yes, I am

651
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:41,075
Ah June is a good boy

652
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:45,325
Are you tired today?

653
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,033
Let me go and wash my face first

654
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,158
You are very nice

655
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:21,492
I've discovered that I am really useless

656
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:28,658
I can't do anything

657
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,908
Before, I only know how to practice
martial arts

658
01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:39,742
What can I do with it?

659
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:47,575
This world...

660
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,242
is really small

661
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,158
I am really useless

662
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:03,658
I don't care what the outside world is like

663
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:08,117
I only know that I am very happy right now

664
01:06:10,408 --> 01:06:14,242
With you and me
and Ah June

665
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:18,783
and if this family don't split up
then there won't be any problems

666
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,658
The most important thing is that
our family stay together

667
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:56,325
Get down!

668
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:59,325
Get down! Get down!

669
01:06:59,658 --> 01:07:01,158
Stand at the side!

670
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,825
Stand one side! Stand one side!

671
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:30,692
Who's the boss? Come out!

672
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:35,900
I am

673
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:49,150
I've just robbed your goods
Now I want to sell it back to you

674
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,483
Any objections?

675
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:52,983
I've no money

676
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:56,108
Don't hit my father

677
01:07:58,608 --> 01:07:59,858
Wing Chun!

678
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,150
Fucking bitch! Wing Chun!

679
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:07,067
Don't hit him!

680
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:12,150
have you got money?

681
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:13,608
No money

682
01:08:13,733 --> 01:08:14,567
Any money?

683
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:17,858
Beat you until you've got money

684
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:29,067
I didn't sell my goods.
I don't have any money

685
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:35,650
Uncle Man! Uncle Man!

686
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:38,192
Come quick, save my father
He's going to be beaten to death soon

687
01:08:38,733 --> 01:08:39,983
What is it, Kwong Yeow?

688
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:40,608
Auntie

689
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:41,983
I'll go and have a look. It's alright

690
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:55,858
Let me tell you. I am very reasonable

691
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,233
You don't have money now...
Ok, I'll give you a little more time

692
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:02,358
I'll keep the goods first

693
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:26,233
Father, are you all right?

694
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:28,525
I am ok. Go and help Uncle Foo

695
01:09:47,942 --> 01:09:48,858
Is there anything I can help?

696
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:53,983
I've always thought that you practice
kung fu is not practical

697
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:56,317
Now I know it's quite useful

698
01:09:57,525 --> 01:10:00,233
If I've known, I would have learn
some from you for self-defense

699
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:01,942
At least I can block a few punches

700
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:06,275
Uncle Man, why don't you stay and
teach us some kung fu?

701
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:09,442
Then we can protect ourselves and
not afraid of being bullied

702
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:11,692
Master Ip

703
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,775
Your kung fu is so great. Please teach us

704
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,525
Please, Master Ip. Please teach us

705
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,608
Teach us, please

706
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,150
Master Ip, please teach us

707
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:25,400
I am a businessman

708
01:10:27,108 --> 01:10:29,150
Besides business, I know nothing else

709
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,483
I can't protect them but you can

710
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:36,567
Before, when it was peaceful,
you said you don't want to teach

711
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,483
Now, everything is so bad
Don't you think you need to do something?

712
01:10:45,025 --> 01:10:46,692
I charge a high fee for teaching kung fu

713
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:50,858
The fees for the students will be paid by you.
You owe me another amount now!

714
01:10:57,317 --> 01:10:59,983
Uncle Man, I want to be your first student

715
01:12:15,483 --> 01:12:17,108
Daddy, I want it a bit higher

716
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:19,233
Want a bit higher? Ok

717
01:12:32,233 --> 01:12:34,358
Why didn't Ip Man come again?

718
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:40,567
I... I don't know

719
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,317
Find him here!

720
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,692
But I really don't know where he is

721
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,025
How can I find him?

722
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:56,067
Fuoshan is not that big.
How hard is it to find him?

723
01:12:56,567 --> 01:13:01,275
Fuoshan is really quite big

724
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:10,067
No!

725
01:13:14,275 --> 01:13:17,067
I really don't know how to find him

726
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:20,192
You're...

727
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,692
such a useless bum
Enough!

728
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,483
Bastard!

729
01:13:29,733 --> 01:13:31,400
Stone, scissor, cloth

730
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:33,858
You all gang up against me

731
01:13:37,817 --> 01:13:39,025
Hide properly!

732
01:13:39,358 --> 01:13:41,525
10, 9, 8, 7
Ah June

733
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:43,567
6, 5, 4
Quickly, go and hide over there

734
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:45,525
3, 2, 1

735
01:13:46,192 --> 01:13:48,900
Here I come! Who will I find first?

736
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:53,150
Master

737
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:54,525
Why are you here?

738
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:58,275
Sanpo wants you to go back and fight with him

739
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:02,650
Let' go

740
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:05,525
No way

741
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:21,942
What are you doing?

742
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:24,442
What are you doing?
What do you want?

743
01:14:25,817 --> 01:14:26,900
What are you doing?

744
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:33,442
Very pretty

745
01:14:54,733 --> 01:14:55,442
Shit!

746
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,442
Let' go. It's not safe here

747
01:15:19,567 --> 01:15:20,442
Let' go, Wing Seng

748
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,733
Li Chian

749
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:50,483
You're... so useless!

750
01:15:51,817 --> 01:15:54,358
How is it possible that Ip Man escape?

751
01:15:54,608 --> 01:15:55,567
I'm sorry

752
01:15:57,608 --> 01:16:02,442
Even Colonel Chuodeng is unable to stop him

753
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:11,067
It is really beyond my capabilities.
I am sorry

754
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,400
so useless!

755
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:15,817
so useless!

756
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:18,108
Give the order down

757
01:16:21,942 --> 01:16:23,817
Dig Ip Man out

758
01:16:24,817 --> 01:16:26,025
Yes

759
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:41,358
Sisters

760
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,942
Come

761
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:47,192
Brother, eat first

762
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:57,400
Master, how is he?

763
01:16:57,567 --> 01:16:59,400
It's alright. They are fine

764
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,108
Master

765
01:17:07,358 --> 01:17:08,483
Coming

766
01:17:12,025 --> 01:17:13,192
Mrs. Ip

767
01:17:14,983 --> 01:17:16,233
See if you can wear this?

768
01:17:17,608 --> 01:17:19,775
How is it?
Are you guys comfortable here?

769
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:21,692
It's okay

770
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:24,692
That's fine then.
When it's time to eat, I'll call

771
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,775
Li Chian

772
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:31,942
I am fine

773
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:35,692
I really don't know what to say

774
01:17:37,442 --> 01:17:38,608
Thank you very much

775
01:17:39,733 --> 01:17:40,900
It's okay

776
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:05,900
We have to leave Fuoshan as soon as possible

777
01:18:07,358 --> 01:18:09,233
Qin Quan is finding a way out for us

778
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:10,400
Go where?

779
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:12,275
Hong Kong

780
01:18:13,108 --> 01:18:15,317
Actually, anywhere is fine with me

781
01:18:20,317 --> 01:18:21,733
I have some friends in Hong Kong

782
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,692
If there is any problems

783
01:18:26,275 --> 01:18:27,733
What will happen to you?

784
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:30,025
You will be fine

785
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:34,608
Are you tired today?

786
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,608
They are here again. Quick, run

787
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:54,192
They are here again. Quick, run

788
01:19:02,525 --> 01:19:04,858
Have you prepared the money?

789
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:06,483
We won't give you the money

790
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:09,567
What did you say?

791
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,233
I am not afraid of you.
We are not easily bullied

792
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,608
Rascal! Haven't got beaten enough, right!?

793
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:27,650
Fucking bitch! Whoever resist
beat them up

794
01:20:15,733 --> 01:20:16,817
Don't fight anymore

795
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:34,358
No wonder you guys dare to resist
you've got somebody as your bodyguard

796
01:20:35,108 --> 01:20:38,108
I came to Fuoshan to open a dojo
You people insult me

797
01:20:39,358 --> 01:20:41,525
Today, you interfere in my business

798
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
Fucking bitch!
You want to force me until I have nowhere to go?

799
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:46,608
No one forcing until you got no way out

800
01:20:46,817 --> 01:20:50,775
Ip Man, have you ever tried being
hungry everyday?

801
01:20:52,567 --> 01:20:54,608
Nowadays, no one has a full meal

802
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,275
On the first day when I came to Fuoshan,
I said

803
01:21:00,483 --> 01:21:02,192
I never want to go hungry again

804
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,775
I never want to suffer hunger again.
Beat them up!

805
01:21:13,858 --> 01:21:14,942
Fight!

806
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,525
Sha Dan Yuan, what are you waiting for? Go!

807
01:22:24,317 --> 01:22:25,275
Go!

808
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,150
Go!

809
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:42,192
Go!

810
01:22:42,317 --> 01:22:43,525
How to fight?

811
01:23:37,983 --> 01:23:38,900
Let' go

812
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:43,983
Master, you're great

813
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,875
Sha Dan Yuan

814
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,458
Stop!

815
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,125
Do you know what you are doing?

816
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,000
I know! I am a thief!

817
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,750
You are robbing your own countrymen

818
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Rather than being bullied,
I've rather bully others

819
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:18,333
I want others to be afraid of me

820
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,167
This is what your brother ask me to give you

821
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,167
Don't ever mention him to me again

822
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:30,417
Do you know that your brother is dead?

823
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,958
He is killed by a Japanese

824
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,583
Your brother have been looking for you all
the while, but was unable to find you

825
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:51,125
Whatever path a man takes,
is their own choice

826
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:07,000
That bastard told Sanpo
that you are in the cotton factory

827
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,333
Please don't go back there

828
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,833
I am going.
Please don't go back there. Remember!

829
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,750
Move quickly!
Quick!

830
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:52,625
Where is Ip Man?

831
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,250
Where is Ip Man? Speak up!

832
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:59,125
Everyone, please don't say

833
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,792
You, come here

834
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,125
Where is Ip Man?

835
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,083
Speak up! Speak! Speak!

836
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:13,167
Asking you!

837
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:14,750
Hang on! I am thinking of a way

838
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:18,250
Speak up! Speak! Speak!

839
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:20,750
I am here. Ip Man is here

840
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:22,458
Ip Man is here! Ip Man is here!

841
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:23,917
I am here

842
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,125
Li Chian

843
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,833
Wait! Please wait!

844
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:29,208
Wait!

845
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,042
Li Chian, tell Sanpo,
it has nothing to do with the workers

846
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,708
Please tell him to let them go

847
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,042
Asked you not to come! Why did you?

848
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:37,125
Tell them!

849
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,250
Chuodeng

850
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,292
He dares beat me up!
Why can't I kill him?

851
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,833
I know what to do

852
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:54,667
Li Chian
Yes

853
01:27:56,208 --> 01:28:02,250
From the moment you resist the Japanese Army

854
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,917
You are already a dead man

855
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:10,250
But I saw that your skills are extraordinary,
someone I could use

856
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:15,000
That is why I am giving you one more chance

857
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:17,500
to be loyal to the Japanese Imperial Army

858
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:23,125
Teach our Imperial Army Chinese kung fu

859
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:29,083
Then, you would have half the
chance of surviving

860
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:34,000
He says he admires you
wants you to teach Japanese Chinese kung fu

861
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,333
I won't teach Japanese!

862
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,750
You really like to see me fight

863
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,542
then I'll fight with you!

864
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:55,458
He says, he will really consider
to be an instructor

865
01:28:55,667 --> 01:29:00,500
He would also like to spar with General Sanpo

866
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:03,333
Bring him back

867
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:05,708
Take him away

868
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,875
Qin Quan, take my wife and kid,
and leave Fuoshan

869
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:28,958
General, do you really want to
fight with Ip Man?

870
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:32,833
Of course!
He is a highly skilled kung fu master

871
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:35,333
But, look at him

872
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:38,208
He don't want to be the instructor
of the Imperial Army

873
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:40,333
He have other motives for wanting
to fight with you

874
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,458
Please don't fight with him

875
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:45,833
Just let me put a bullet through him

876
01:29:46,042 --> 01:29:52,500
He knows he is better.
That's why he wants to fight with you

877
01:29:53,958 --> 01:30:03,875
If I don't accept the challenge

878
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:10,458
and kill him

879
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:24,208
then what is the difference between
admitting defeat?

880
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,542
General fighting with a Chinese man

881
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,875
is not a personal concern but

882
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:35,083
It also the concern of Japan as well

883
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:37,792
Are you saying I will lose?

884
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:40,458
I am just being cautious

885
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,458
I will definitely win

886
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:46,875
I also want the whole of China to know

887
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,917
Yes, I know

888
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:32,625
I didn't kill you and
want you to be the instructor

889
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:38,500
is because I admire your skill in kung fu

890
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:43,458
but I don't think that Chinese martial
arts is better than Japanese martial arts

891
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:49,583
because we will be fighting in
front of all those people

892
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:52,250
That is why, this should be a fair fight

893
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:57,792
You occupied my country. Killed my country men

894
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,958
Take back your insults

895
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,500
Excuse me

896
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:27,792
Let go of my mother
Let me go! Let me go back!

897
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,125
I've promised Ip Man.
I won't let anything happen to both of you

898
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:32,125
Going back is too dangerous

899
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:41,000
I heard that a Japanese is having
a duel with a Chinese

900
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:41,875
Who is it?

901
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,875
Ip Man!

902
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,292
Look at this place, it's all sealed up

903
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,792
I used to hope that he accompany me everyday

904
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,708
That's why I reprimanded him and his
martial arts practice

905
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,833
Every time he fights with someone
I would throw my temper

906
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:16,792
I've never really supported him
to do what he likes to do

907
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:23,250
Now, this may be his last fight

908
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,333
I am afraid there won't be
a chance from now on

909
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,792
Why don't you give me that chance?

910
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,083
Why?

911
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:46,375
General Sanpo says, he wanted to
strengthen Sino-Japanese Cultural exchange

912
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:50,875
Today, with Master Ip here, will
be a fair fight

913
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:54,833
Exchange of ideas. Friendship through
martial arts

914
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:57,417
To realize Sino-Japanese peace

915
01:33:57,917 --> 01:34:00,542
Fair fight!? Really sounds good, huh?

916
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:05,083
Look at that traitor's face! Sooner or
later he will be killed by the Japanese

917
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,417
You're right!

918
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,417
Master Ip is coming

919
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:33,917
What did General Sanpo spoke to you about?
Talk about the fight?

920
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I really don't care

921
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:40,292
Listen carefully!
If you win the fight

922
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:43,167
I will kill you immediately with my gun

923
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,083
Remember!

924
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:45,292
Yes

925
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:49,125
Please, don't win the fight with Sanpo

926
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:51,958
If you win, he will kill you

927
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:55,833
Be careful for your life.
That is most important

928
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,958
Martial arts may be a form of brute strength

929
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:05,583
but in our Chinese martial arts system
but it includes many ideals and philosophy

930
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:10,208
Martial arts rules, which is also compassion.
To help others

931
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,958
This is what you Japanese will never
never understand

932
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:14,625
because you use this strength

933
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,875
and change it into brutal power
to terrorize others

934
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,667
That is why you are not fit to
learn Chinese martial arts
